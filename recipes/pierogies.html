    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pierogi are filled dumplings made by wrapping unleavened dough around a
       savoury or sweet filling and cooking in boiling water. They are often 
       pan-fried before serving. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>4 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
      <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>5 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a food processor, combine flour and salt; cover and pulse to 
        blend. Add water, eggs and butter; cover and pulse until dough forms
        a ball, adding an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if
        needed. Let rest, covered, 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a
        boil over high heat. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until tender, 
        10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, 
        saute onions in butter until tender.</li>
      <li>Drain potatoes. Over very low heat, stir potatoes until steam has
        evaporated, 1-2 minutes. Press through a potato ricer or strainer
        into a large bowl. Stir in cream cheese, salt, pepper and onion 
        mixture.</li>
      <li>Divide dough into 4 parts. On a lightly floured surface, roll 1 
        portion of dough to 1/8-in. thickness; cut with a floured 3-in. 
        biscuit cutter. Place 2 teaspoons of filling in center of each circle.
        Moisten edges with water; fold in half and press edges to seal. 
        Repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li>
      <li>Bring a Dutch oven of water to a boil over high heat; add pierogi in
        batches. Reduce heat to a gentle simmer; cook until pierogi float to
        the top and are tender, 1-2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon. In
        a large skillet, saute 4 pierogi and onion in butter until pierogi are 
        lightly browned and heated through; sprinkle with parsley. Repeat with 
        remaining pierogi.</li>
