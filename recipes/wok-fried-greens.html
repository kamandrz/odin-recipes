    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These Wok-Fried Greens are saucy, salty-sweet, garlicky, slightly
      caramelised and perfectly crunchy! They're naturally vegan and
      gluten-free, and make the perfect quick and easy side dish that's full
      of flavour but also happens to be really healthy too.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce (or tamari if gluten-free)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar (or sub any other sweetener)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>Ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons oil (vegetable or rapeseed)</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>150g tenderstem broccoli</li>
      <li>200g pak choi</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix together all the ingredients for the sauce in a small bowl.</li>
      <li>Heat up the oil in wok or frying pan.</li>
      <li>Add the garlic and fry on a low heat for around 30 seconds, until
        fragrant and lightly browned - be very careful not to burn it!</li>
      <li>Add the broccoli and pak choi and the sauce.</li>
      <li>Cook on a medium heat for around 5 minutes, stirring regularly,
        until vegetables are cooked to your liking. I like to keep them
        slightly crunchy, but for more thoroughly cooked vegetables you can
        cook them for longer and cover the wok or frying pan with a lid.</li>
      <li>Taste and add extra soy sauce (or tamari) if necessary.</li>
      <li>Best enjoyed immediately!</li>
    </ol>
